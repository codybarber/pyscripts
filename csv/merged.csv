I am 1.88cm (6'2"") and 77 kgs (169 lbs) now.

Before Image is from 4th of March, when I was 85 kgs (187 lbs).

After Image is today (31st of July).

**Stats:**

Height: 188 cm (6'2"")

Weight: 77 kgs

**Lifts:**

Squat: 100 kgs x5

Deadlift: 115 kgs x5

Bench: 70 kgs x5

OHP: 47.5 kgs x5

**Background:**

I began going to Gym two years ago, but started just with cardio (because I was 90 KGs with 30+% bodyfat). Afterwards I have done a weird split (mo: back + tris, wed: chest + bis, fri: legs) without any compound movements (I couldn't do a single pushup back then) for couple of months, with a lot of cardio. In one year I was like 78 kgs.

After that 1 year of BS, I began doing Stronglifts 5x5 and learned compound movements. While doing that I wanted to bulk, which I couldn't control myself after a point. In 2,5 months I gained 7 kgs (became 85), and just began to binge eating. Afterwards I stayed at 85 kgs for 3 months (while doing 5/3/1 BBB), until the date of the before picture. Then I decided to cut down (with Reddit PPL) to 10-12% body fat to lean bulk. In 4 months, I have lost 8 kgs and I am 77 kgs right now.

&#x200B;

[4th of March - 31st of July](https://i.redd.it/oofb34xgknd31.png)

**Future:**

Right now, I believe that I am around 15% body fat (according to the navy method, which can be false). I am planning to go down to 12%, therefore I am planning to lose 3-4 kgs more in 2 months (until mid September). Afterwards, I will begin my lean bulk of getting 1kgs per month. I hope that I will also send that transformation here.

Recently added HIIT via Camp Gladiator 1 hr 2-3 times a week. Got my body fat measured through Camp Gladiator. And got 22% via Body Impedance Analysis. Was tracking macros with total calories at ~1700 and splits at 50% protein 25% carbs 25% fat. It was recommended to me to increase my total calories to 2000 and modify my splits to 35% protein 35% carbs 30% fat. My goal is to get to between 15%-18% which means losing about 10 more lbs of body fat and increasing maybe 2-3 more lbs of lean muscle.

Bulked pretty hard this winter, went from my leanest of 160 to about 182 at around 17% body fat, obviously a fair amount of fat gained. Anyway, I was dreading the cut but thanks to a very aggressive deficit (do not recommend) and an absurd amount of cardio ( averaged 5 days a week at 45 mins) I was able to drop the fat I gained relatively quickly.",Brogress,2019-07-03 06:18:23,"['M', '20', '5\'9"" ', '184lbs ', ' 163lbs', ' (10 weeks) (B: 295lbs; S: 410lbs)']",M,20,"5'9"" ",184lbs , 163lbs

Hey guys,

&#x200B;

I always go through this sub for motivation, and its cool to see people making heaps of progress. [Anyway I though I'd make my own post after going to the gym consistently for 2 months (my before and after are in this link).](https://imgur.com/a/irJC9Vz) I see theres one vein in my arm that wasnt there before and I feel really proud of that aha. I've always been relatively active, through sports and things although have never stepped inside a gym until 2 months ago. In my first pic, I had a body scan and found out I was 22% body fat, I dont know what I am not and whether that has changed much. At the moment I'm just trying to eat heaps with the idea of getting bigger. Once I started tracking my meals I realised that getting a surplus was actually really difficult. I'm back studying currently and so quite poor so any tips on cheap ways to eat heaps is appreciated.

&#x200B;

As for my program, I was doing full body workout, that I got off one of the trainers at my local gym, 2 days on, one day rest, and have just switched to the reddit ppl - linear progression. 6 days on, 1 day off.

My starting lifts were really low (like way lower than I could lift comfortably eg squatting just the bar) so I have just added my current lifts I guess. They are all just my weights for 5x 5 reps.

Dead lift 5x 100kg

Bench press 5x 50kg

Squat 5x 80kg

OHP 5x 37.5kg

&#x200B;

After always seeing myself as a relatively fit and active guy, going to the gym has been a really humbling experience. Seeing people half my size lifting twice my max everyday is pretty impressive. I guess as they say, the day you step into the gym is the day you are forever small.

Thanks!

Unfortunately the only pictures I have of the before show only my torso, because I used them to ask for a BF estimation, I may be able to find some others in my laptop but the before pictures represent well what I was like, a skinny guy with non-defined abs, I had a wider shoulder than usual guys when the same body shape, with a good posture and generally didn’t gain much fat no matter what I ate.
I basically looked like an average healthy person

At that point I had been training for 2 years, on and off whilst I made progress I basically lost a lot of it because at the time of the picture I had stopped lifting for over 6 months.

Like many people starting I was bombarded with different people saying different things, meaning I never really stuck to one thing, I won’t get into detail because what I did wrong isn’t relevant, what I did right is and that’s all below.

———————————————————

It’s been 5 years since the before pictures, during that time I learned a lot more about   bodybuilding, not just from books and studies but from personal experience, which is my first point, research isn’t specific to you and there are many factors which just cannot be controlled, therefore, whilst studies may be useful (I myself I’m studying a Master’s in Economics and I’m aware of the importance of research), they are not the truth, the truth in this case is what you can see with your eyes and if it works for you you shouldn’t care about what Dr. ResearchMan has to say.

Training

Once I had a good basic knowledge (which I gained from people that looked the way I wanted to look like and not some
study on muscle activation), I started to implement it, it changed over the 5 years but I will try to explain the logic (in my mind at the time) which I based my decisions on.

Phase 1 -  Build a base, gain overall size and strength

I never prepared a workout plan and followed it every week, whilst for some people that may be useful (and if that’s your case go for it), to me it’s all about what you feel like you need doing.
E.g. if I felt like I had to hit chest harder I would add more sets for it, if I felt like I wasn’t ready to go heavy I would add more isolate exercises like cables or lighter dumbbells and go for higher reps.

Though the basic idea was to do mostly compound exercises, with the addition of some isolations exercises depending on how I felt.
I trained around 4x a week but as I saw I went by what I felt I needed, if I needed more rest to really go hard the next day then I would just do 3x, basically you know your body better than anyone, just be honest to yourself, do you actually need a
rest or it’s just an excuse?

Main compounds were:

Squats, Deadlifts, Bench Press, Shoulder
Press, Barbell Rows.

I would pick one of the to be my first one in the day and go as heavy as possible, always trying to do at least 5 reps, if I couldn’t I would do as many as possible then decrease weight and do as many as possible again.
Sets didn’t really matter, what matters is if you feel you done enough, that could be 3 sets or 6 sets.

Then I would do at least 2 more compounds, following the same principle as the first exercise, and then do isolation exercises, where I would go for higher reps.

Repetition range was between 8-12 reps for upper body, with the exception of shoulder which it could go up to 16 and 12-20 reps for lower body.
I found that lower body responded better with higher reps and lower weights, could go into more detail about that at some point.

During this phase I aimed at a full body workout, which was achieved with at least 1 compound for lower body and one for upper, plus the addition of some isolations.

I paid extra attention to my deltoids, firstly because I always got a massive pump from it but also because I knew about the importance of wide shoulder aesthetically, Rear Deltoids in particular which I attribute my growth doing Rear Delt Bent Over flies (both with dumbbells and on the cable).

Phase 2 - Experimentations

Once I felt like I was strong enough and generally looked like I lifted I started experimenting with different body splits, rep ranges, style of training, including following more strict programmes or YouTuber’s plans.

I won’t list them all but I tried a few (no where near as many as there are out there because there are just too many), what I found is that your body will respond best to whatever it responds best, FST-7, mountain dog or whatever won’t maximize your growth, pushing your body as much as possible will.

That could be with dropsets, supersets, isometric holds, 5 sec rests or whatever as long as you done enough (most people don’t know what that feels like until they manage to do it once) you will grow.

Phase 3 - The discovery of what actually worked

I will bullet point to make it simpler to follow

- At least 1 heavy compound in every session, always trying to go heavier and if you can’t go heavier do more reps

- If you can’t go heavier or add more reps then you do partial reps, if you can’t do that then hold the weight as long as possible (as long as it’s safe)

- Do isolation exercises with a purpose, don’t just do front shoulder raises for the sake of it, you active the frontal Delt enough with chest exercises so to me it is useless in most cases

- Lower body responds better to higher reps rather then heavy weights, but still do both, one day do heavy squats, the next time do 15 reps at least

- To get a thick back add any type of rows as heavy as possible as long as posture is right, with a lot of drop sets.

- Shoulder, do barbell shoulder press, heavy, lateral raises are best done with higher reps, but you may also choose to go heavier (even if you cheat a bit) same as legs do both but preferably on the same day rather than doing one day heavy and the other lighter

- Hit Rear delts directly 2x a week, my favourites are Rear delt reverse flies and reverse chest flies (on the machine), higher reps, with at least 2 drop set

- Arms, it’s my weak body part but it grew best once I started giving it two days rest, I train 4x a week so the last training session I would do arms

- Do biceps and triceps on the same day, superset them, with minimum rest between sets, just enough to catch your breath, I do at least 4 supersets with at least 3 sets each but could go up to 6 sets, it is a lot but it worked for me and my arms are pumped like nothing else

- Every arm session do biceps curls and  triceps Skullcrusher, they are the best to add size in my opinion

- Close grip bench press is the second best to add size on triceps

- Avoid crazy biceps curls variations, stick to basics with full range of motion (full range of motion of biceps would be when you contract your triceps, e.g on a biceps curl, extend your arms at the bottom as much as possible, that will make the exercise harder and therefore more effective

- Chest, also a weak area, piston style, meaning no rest when your arm is extended, controlling the way down and then a powerful push, that is done to maximize time under tension

- Bench presses I do with dumbbells and go heavy 2 sets doing around 6 reps and lighter the next 2 sets

- I never do flat bench, I always do on the least incline, as it activates the chest better

- 45degree incline is always my first chest exercise

- Never did decline bench, to me it’s unnecessary, much like frontal delt exercises 

- Legs, squats isn’t really necessary but if you don’t have any knee problem than absolute do it

- Bulgarian Split Squats is a great exercise for quads

- Do hip thrusts occasionally, glutes are important no only aesthetically (woman love nice glutes) but also for heavy lifting

- Leg presses don’t do too heavy, aim to do 15 reps, same with leg extensions

- Abs, never do it unless I just feel it like.

- Cardio - only if I need a boost to lose fat, but I definitely recommend doing it, it’s great for health

Diet

Simply eat clean, I need more calories than the usual person to grow so usually at least 3800 calories, which comes mostly from clean sources.

I do a shake in the morning with milk, oats, whey, liquid egg whites and peanut butter, if I do 2 of them I can hit 1500 calories easily and then the rest comes from solid food.

Protein: I like it 1g/lbs at least, as long as I get that I’m happy

Fat: just don’t go over board, saturated fat is bad in excess but you need a certain amount of it for health

Carbs: a lot when im trying to grow, then when I diet I usually do a carb cycling with more carbs on leg day, moderate on other training days and low when I’m not training

I never recommend “eat whatever as long as you getting enough protein” I did grow doing that but I also didn’t feel good and didn’t look as good as when I was doing it clean.

Supplements - only whey protein out of the ones people mention for mass, then I do vitamin d3, fish oil and caffeine when I’m cutting

Dieting - I like to have a deficit of at least 500 calories, first I will set the protein to 1g/lbs then calculate how many calories are left, I usually stick to 50g fats and the rest from carbs, that may change and does change when carb cycling.

I generally enjoy dieting but if I found that drinking coffee helps me feel less hungry

No fat burners, no pre workouts, no creatine, no carb powders.


BCAA - useful when dieting, but you need way more than recommended dose, to the point that it’s much cheaper to buy real food, plus as long as you get enough protein you don’t really need any protein supplement

Protein sources - liquid egg white is the best source there is, I buy pasteurized cartoons and use them on shake

2nd best is fish which I try to eat regularly but it’s more expensive, buy white fish like tilapia or cod which are more affordable.

3rd best is chicken breast, which is my main meat

4rd lean mince, is my last meal, as it is a slower digesting protein

Whey protein, drink in the morning or after workout, I don’t see the point drink any other time if you are eating enough regularly.

Eat every few hours, I find it easier to eat 3/4 big meals but my body looks and I feel better eating 4/5 meals.

Basically set your protein 1g/lbs then divide that into 5 meals and try to eat that much protein each meal.",Brogress,2019-06-15 00:13:16,"['M22 5’11 ', ' 174lbs —', ' 210lbs ', ' 5 Years']",M22 5’11 , 174lbs —, 210lbs , 5 Years,

I am 1.88cm (6'2"") and 77 kgs (169 lbs) now.

Before Image is from 4th of March, when I was 85 kgs (187 lbs).

After Image is today (31st of July).

**Stats:**

Height: 188 cm (6'2"")

Weight: 77 kgs

**Lifts:**

Squat: 100 kgs x5

Deadlift: 115 kgs x5

Bench: 70 kgs x5

OHP: 47.5 kgs x5

**Background:**

I began going to Gym two years ago, but started just with cardio (because I was 90 KGs with 30+% bodyfat). Afterwards I have done a weird split (mo: back + tris, wed: chest + bis, fri: legs) without any compound movements (I couldn't do a single pushup back then) for couple of months, with a lot of cardio. In one year I was like 78 kgs.

After that 1 year of BS, I began doing Stronglifts 5x5 and learned compound movements. While doing that I wanted to bulk, which I couldn't control myself after a point. In 2,5 months I gained 7 kgs (became 85), and just began to binge eating. Afterwards I stayed at 85 kgs for 3 months (while doing 5/3/1 BBB), until the date of the before picture. Then I decided to cut down (with Reddit PPL) to 10-12% body fat to lean bulk. In 4 months, I have lost 8 kgs and I am 77 kgs right now.

&#x200B;

[4th of March - 31st of July](https://i.redd.it/oofb34xgknd31.png)

**Future:**

Right now, I believe that I am around 15% body fat (according to the navy method, which can be false). I am planning to go down to 12%, therefore I am planning to lose 3-4 kgs more in 2 months (until mid September). Afterwards, I will begin my lean bulk of getting 1kgs per month. I hope that I will also send that transformation here.

Recently added HIIT via Camp Gladiator 1 hr 2-3 times a week. Got my body fat measured through Camp Gladiator. And got 22% via Body Impedance Analysis. Was tracking macros with total calories at ~1700 and splits at 50% protein 25% carbs 25% fat. It was recommended to me to increase my total calories to 2000 and modify my splits to 35% protein 35% carbs 30% fat. My goal is to get to between 15%-18% which means losing about 10 more lbs of body fat and increasing maybe 2-3 more lbs of lean muscle.

Hey guys,

&#x200B;

I always go through this sub for motivation, and its cool to see people making heaps of progress. [Anyway I though I'd make my own post after going to the gym consistently for 2 months (my before and after are in this link).](https://imgur.com/a/irJC9Vz) I see theres one vein in my arm that wasnt there before and I feel really proud of that aha. I've always been relatively active, through sports and things although have never stepped inside a gym until 2 months ago. In my first pic, I had a body scan and found out I was 22% body fat, I dont know what I am not and whether that has changed much. At the moment I'm just trying to eat heaps with the idea of getting bigger. Once I started tracking my meals I realised that getting a surplus was actually really difficult. I'm back studying currently and so quite poor so any tips on cheap ways to eat heaps is appreciated.

&#x200B;

As for my program, I was doing full body workout, that I got off one of the trainers at my local gym, 2 days on, one day rest, and have just switched to the reddit ppl - linear progression. 6 days on, 1 day off.

My starting lifts were really low (like way lower than I could lift comfortably eg squatting just the bar) so I have just added my current lifts I guess. They are all just my weights for 5x 5 reps.

Dead lift 5x 100kg

Bench press 5x 50kg

Squat 5x 80kg

OHP 5x 37.5kg

&#x200B;

After always seeing myself as a relatively fit and active guy, going to the gym has been a really humbling experience. Seeing people half my size lifting twice my max everyday is pretty impressive. I guess as they say, the day you step into the gym is the day you are forever small.

Thanks!

It’s been 5 years since the before pictures, during that time I learned a lot more about   bodybuilding, not just from books and studies but from personal experience, which is my first point, research isn’t specific to you and there are many factors which just cannot be controlled, therefore, whilst studies may be useful (I myself I’m studying a Master’s in Economics and I’m aware of the importance of research), they are not the truth, the truth in this case is what you can see with your eyes and if it works for you you shouldn’t care about what Dr. ResearchMan has to say.

Training

Once I had a good basic knowledge (which I gained from people that looked the way I wanted to look like and not some
study on muscle activation), I started to implement it, it changed over the 5 years but I will try to explain the logic (in my mind at the time) which I based my decisions on.

Phase 1 -  Build a base, gain overall size and strength

I never prepared a workout plan and followed it every week, whilst for some people that may be useful (and if that’s your case go for it), to me it’s all about what you feel like you need doing.
E.g. if I felt like I had to hit chest harder I would add more sets for it, if I felt like I wasn’t ready to go heavy I would add more isolate exercises like cables or lighter dumbbells and go for higher reps.

Though the basic idea was to do mostly compound exercises, with the addition of some isolations exercises depending on how I felt.
I trained around 4x a week but as I saw I went by what I felt I needed, if I needed more rest to really go hard the next day then I would just do 3x, basically you know your body better than anyone, just be honest to yourself, do you actually need a
rest or it’s just an excuse?

Main compounds were:

Squats, Deadlifts, Bench Press, Shoulder
Press, Barbell Rows.

I would pick one of the to be my first one in the day and go as heavy as possible, always trying to do at least 5 reps, if I couldn’t I would do as many as possible then decrease weight and do as many as possible again.
Sets didn’t really matter, what matters is if you feel you done enough, that could be 3 sets or 6 sets.

Then I would do at least 2 more compounds, following the same principle as the first exercise, and then do isolation exercises, where I would go for higher reps.

Repetition range was between 8-12 reps for upper body, with the exception of shoulder which it could go up to 16 and 12-20 reps for lower body.
I found that lower body responded better with higher reps and lower weights, could go into more detail about that at some point.

During this phase I aimed at a full body workout, which was achieved with at least 1 compound for lower body and one for upper, plus the addition of some isolations.

I paid extra attention to my deltoids, firstly because I always got a massive pump from it but also because I knew about the importance of wide shoulder aesthetically, Rear Deltoids in particular which I attribute my growth doing Rear Delt Bent Over flies (both with dumbbells and on the cable).

Phase 2 - Experimentations

Once I felt like I was strong enough and generally looked like I lifted I started experimenting with different body splits, rep ranges, style of training, including following more strict programmes or YouTuber’s plans.

I won’t list them all but I tried a few (no where near as many as there are out there because there are just too many), what I found is that your body will respond best to whatever it responds best, FST-7, mountain dog or whatever won’t maximize your growth, pushing your body as much as possible will.

That could be with dropsets, supersets, isometric holds, 5 sec rests or whatever as long as you done enough (most people don’t know what that feels like until they manage to do it once) you will grow.

Phase 3 - The discovery of what actually worked

I will bullet point to make it simpler to follow

- At least 1 heavy compound in every session, always trying to go heavier and if you can’t go heavier do more reps

- If you can’t go heavier or add more reps then you do partial reps, if you can’t do that then hold the weight as long as possible (as long as it’s safe)

- Do isolation exercises with a purpose, don’t just do front shoulder raises for the sake of it, you active the frontal Delt enough with chest exercises so to me it is useless in most cases

- Lower body responds better to higher reps rather then heavy weights, but still do both, one day do heavy squats, the next time do 15 reps at least

- To get a thick back add any type of rows as heavy as possible as long as posture is right, with a lot of drop sets.

- Shoulder, do barbell shoulder press, heavy, lateral raises are best done with higher reps, but you may also choose to go heavier (even if you cheat a bit) same as legs do both but preferably on the same day rather than doing one day heavy and the other lighter

- Hit Rear delts directly 2x a week, my favourites are Rear delt reverse flies and reverse chest flies (on the machine), higher reps, with at least 2 drop set

- Arms, it’s my weak body part but it grew best once I started giving it two days rest, I train 4x a week so the last training session I would do arms

- Do biceps and triceps on the same day, superset them, with minimum rest between sets, just enough to catch your breath, I do at least 4 supersets with at least 3 sets each but could go up to 6 sets, it is a lot but it worked for me and my arms are pumped like nothing else

- Every arm session do biceps curls and  triceps Skullcrusher, they are the best to add size in my opinion

- Close grip bench press is the second best to add size on triceps

- Avoid crazy biceps curls variations, stick to basics with full range of motion (full range of motion of biceps would be when you contract your triceps, e.g on a biceps curl, extend your arms at the bottom as much as possible, that will make the exercise harder and therefore more effective

- Chest, also a weak area, piston style, meaning no rest when your arm is extended, controlling the way down and then a powerful push, that is done to maximize time under tension

- Bench presses I do with dumbbells and go heavy 2 sets doing around 6 reps and lighter the next 2 sets

- I never do flat bench, I always do on the least incline, as it activates the chest better

- 45degree incline is always my first chest exercise

- Never did decline bench, to me it’s unnecessary, much like frontal delt exercises 

- Legs, squats isn’t really necessary but if you don’t have any knee problem than absolute do it

- Bulgarian Split Squats is a great exercise for quads

- Do hip thrusts occasionally, glutes are important no only aesthetically (woman love nice glutes) but also for heavy lifting

- Leg presses don’t do too heavy, aim to do 15 reps, same with leg extensions

- Abs, never do it unless I just feel it like.

- Cardio - only if I need a boost to lose fat, but I definitely recommend doing it, it’s great for health

Diet

Simply eat clean, I need more calories than the usual person to grow so usually at least 3800 calories, which comes mostly from clean sources.

I do a shake in the morning with milk, oats, whey, liquid egg whites and peanut butter, if I do 2 of them I can hit 1500 calories easily and then the rest comes from solid food.

Protein: I like it 1g/lbs at least, as long as I get that I’m happy

Fat: just don’t go over board, saturated fat is bad in excess but you need a certain amount of it for health

Carbs: a lot when im trying to grow, then when I diet I usually do a carb cycling with more carbs on leg day, moderate on other training days and low when I’m not training

I never recommend “eat whatever as long as you getting enough protein” I did grow doing that but I also didn’t feel good and didn’t look as good as when I was doing it clean.

Supplements - only whey protein out of the ones people mention for mass, then I do vitamin d3, fish oil and caffeine when I’m cutting

Dieting - I like to have a deficit of at least 500 calories, first I will set the protein to 1g/lbs then calculate how many calories are left, I usually stick to 50g fats and the rest from carbs, that may change and does change when carb cycling.

I generally enjoy dieting but if I found that drinking coffee helps me feel less hungry

No fat burners, no pre workouts, no creatine, no carb powders.


BCAA - useful when dieting, but you need way more than recommended dose, to the point that it’s much cheaper to buy real food, plus as long as you get enough protein you don’t really need any protein supplement

Protein sources - liquid egg white is the best source there is, I buy pasteurized cartoons and use them on shake

2nd best is fish which I try to eat regularly but it’s more expensive, buy white fish like tilapia or cod which are more affordable.

3rd best is chicken breast, which is my main meat

4rd lean mince, is my last meal, as it is a slower digesting protein

Whey protein, drink in the morning or after workout, I don’t see the point drink any other time if you are eating enough regularly.

6 months but a lot of it was muscle memory. I eat typically 

3500 calories a day

180-200g of protein

100-130g Fat

405-500g of carbs. Although carbs I have the least control over. 

There were days when I went hiking I had to eat 5k those days. 

Some weeks I would eat 4K for three days and end up not eating very much sub 2k for sure 3 days of the week. 

Lifts starting out we’re:

Bench 1RM:135

Squat:185

Deadlift:250

Now although they are probably higher haven’t got to test them and I’m 4 weeks out from testing them are 

Bench 1RM:250

Squat:325

Deadlift:365



I’ve always always been the skinny kid my whole life 140 was my peak weight for 23 years of my life. I did get up to 176 last year which explains why my lifts sky rocketed but had to stop working out for a little while. I just couldn’t take being the scrawny kid anymore. i just started doing a lot of research on nutrition and resistance training. Just changed up my lifestyle and gained the weight. Women look at me different. I get more respect during day to day life. I also feel amazing and confident all the time. I help a few friends lose and gain some weight. Overall I feel great being able to feel fit, look good and, help others around me by doing what i love.





I’ve trained with a coach this whole time and he does my programming monthly. I’ve trained powerlifting specific the duration of my training so far. 



It feels way better walking around at 185 vs 140.
